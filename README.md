## Q&A

<details>
   <summary>What is the background of the development of this tool? </summary>
   <p> Since the author has been engaged in the security industry, he has been focusing on the field of traffic security analysis, and is also interested in software research and development.
   On the one hand, this project is to share the usual research results and promote exchanges and learning. On the other hand, there is too little communication with the blue team in China. Now there are more red teams. I hope this way can be used to form a blue team. communication group
